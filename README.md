## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Linux (Ubuntu VPS)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx Reverse Proxy
- Flask (Backend)
- Postgres (Database)
- Prometheus
- Grafana

---

## ⚙️ Production Environment Setup

- Designed and deployed a fullstack application using Docker multi-container architecture
- Configured Nginx reverse proxy for domain and subdomain routing
- Managed isolated services (application, monitoring, lab environment)
- Implemented monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana
- Performed troubleshooting and service optimization to maintain system stability
- Managed VPS server independently as a production environment

---

## 📊 Monitoring Implementation

The monitoring stack is deployed on a dedicated subdomain and integrated using Prometheus as a metrics collector and Grafana for visualization.

Current implementation includes:
- Application metrics collection
- Service-level monitoring
- Real-time metric visualization

Further improvements:
- System-level monitoring (CPU, RAM, Disk)
- Alerting configuration
- CI/CD automation integration

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project was built to simulate a real production-ready DevOps environment, focusing on:

- Containerized deployment
- Infrastructure management
- Observability
- Reverse proxy configuration
- Real-world server maintenance

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- CI/CD automation pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Node Exporter for system monitoring
- Alerting & logging integration
- Infrastructure automation scripting
